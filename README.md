End of Semester Reflections:

What is this purpose of this Git repository?
-The purpose of this repository is to have a place to work on, store, and display my projects to other people (potential employers, collaboraters...etc). It is also an easy place for me to comfortably work with a familiar framework and interface and get started on future undertakings in the future!

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
-My favorite assignment was Assignment 4 because we got to experiment on another partners code and try everyting we've learned while being create to try and break, rather than build, something. It was also a cool insight into hacking which has been so heavily romanticized on television...etc. 

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I think I have grown a lot from day 1 of this course. I learned a lot more about the process of development in general and how to survive in the constantly changing world of modern web development. I think this class helped me mature and become better at working on projects in situations similar to the ones I will face professionally. 

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
1) How to be okay with not understanding temporarily a certain topic or syntactic bit of code. This was constantly the case, because we were learning things so fast, I never had time to completely understand a topic the way I had time to in high school and in other areas of my education at tufts up to this point. 
2) Working and communicating with others on projects. Whether this is trying to understand the code someone posted on StackOverflow and understand their train of thought, or meeting face to face with my semester group project parnters to discuess what direction we should take our project, working with and understanding other people in this sector of Computer Science was especially challenging for me to deal with at first. I also think I made a lot of progress in this regard as time went by. You don't have to be best friends with somebody to work with them effectively!

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
-There is not necessarily a single area I think I really want to dive into, I think I just need to go back and learn some things a little bit more in depth to firmly grasp them (so I could for example speak to them in a job interview). If I brushed up on stuff a bit more to understand it conceptually I think that would suit me well for the future!
