What is this purpose of this Git repository?
-The purpose of this Git repository is to have a location / portfolio that I can use to collect, work on, and display my work. This is a big benefit both to future job opportunities as well as getting me started with an environment for working on projects!

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
-My favorite assignment was the first assignment (making the personal website). I had a lof of fun designing the site and felt like I was making something useful for myself while learning a lot at the same time. Also, unlike Assignment 2 and 3, we had all the tools to really dig into this project without so much outside research and experimenting which was nice. 

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
-I honestly think I have grown a lot from day 1 of the course up until now. I have matured a lot about things like researching my own problems, asking for help, and being responsible about my work. I also had to deal with the very overwhelming amount of information involved in becoming a web programmer and as such learned that it's okay to not understand a concept at first, at that especially in this industry, everyone is always learning new things. 

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
1) Not being afraid to "dive in" to a project or lab. A lot of the time, I would hesitate to start a project because I would be worried about the logistics of dealing with errors, setting up the server on my computer...etc. The most important thing I learned about this is the best thing is just to get set up and try stuff, you never know how big of a breakthrough you can make by trial and error with the help of outside research and investigation. Especially for assignment 4, I learned a lot by just downloading the code and throwing things at it until something stuck. 
2) Building off my own knowledge to learn in news ways. For example, I learned about the developer tools on the first few days of class. Later on in the course, I used this to see how other well built websites achieved their effects and replciating them on my own work and on the final project. 
3) I also learned a lot about the DIFFICULTIES of working in a group for a single vision, a lot of people are hard to talk to and very stubborn. Other times, I just didn't get a long with somebody (this was especially true on my semester project). The most important thing is that you are able to at least work somebody, even if you aren't their best friend. 

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
-I would like to delve into a lot of things more deeply, but specifically I'm super interested in learning these code concepts (like node.js/express) so I can understand them better conceptually and be able to explain design strategies and tactics from a more abstract point of view. Sometimes I feel like since we have so much material in this class to cover, some areas of my knowledge has holes in it because we had to speed through things to quickly!
