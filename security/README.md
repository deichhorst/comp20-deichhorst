Name: Dexter Eichhorst

Total Time Spent on Project so far: 5 Hours

Collaborated with: My partner Mateo Davis about coordinating code-sharing...etc. 
Kevin Halliday about presentation details and how to coordinate optimal testing environment (testing locally...etc).

I have identified all of my security flaws. My security/index.html page is finished and documents all vulnerabilites in my partners server code. As far as I can tell, I'm done!
